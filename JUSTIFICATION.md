# Justification

## LICENSE
The license that I chose is the GNU AGPLv3. I chose this license because it is the strongest copyleft license at the moment. I prefer Copyleft licenses over permissive licenses, because permissive licenses allow derivative projects to be proprietary, taking your work and contributing nothing back.

## Code of Conduct
I chose to use the code of conduct from [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). I chose this because I believed that it has detailed explanations of consequences for violating the code of conduct, as well as how it **impacts the community as a whole**.
